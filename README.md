# Using the Tool

Using the tool is a 3-step process.
1. Voter aquisition (and vote weight)
2. Collecting motions
3. Aggregate actual votes and calculate result

## 1. Voter aquisition

First, the programm needs to know how many voters are invloved 
and how much their vote weights.

## 2. Collecting Motions

Second, the programm needs to know which motions are to be voted 
on so it can create a aggregation table from the voters and the 
motions.

## 3. Aggregating votes

Lastly, you enter the votes into the table and the programms can 
then calculate results, which are saved in a .html file in an 
easy readable format.
